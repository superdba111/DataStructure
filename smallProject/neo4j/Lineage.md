Let's assume we have three entities: Source, Transformation, and Destination. Each of these entities will be represented as nodes in the graph. We'll also use relationships to represent the flow of data between these entities.

### Create Source nodes

CREATE (:Source {name: 'Source A'})
CREATE (:Source {name: 'Source B'})

### Create Transformation nodes

CREATE (:Transformation {name: 'Transformation 1'})
CREATE (:Transformation {name: 'Transformation 2'})

### Create Destination nodes

CREATE (:Destination {name: 'Destination X'})
CREATE (:Destination {name: 'Destination Y'})

### Connect Source A to Transformation 1

MATCH (s:Source {name: 'Source A'}), (t:Transformation {name: 'Transformation 1'})
CREATE (s)-[:DATA_FLOW]->(t)

### Connect Transformation 1 to Destination X

MATCH (t:Transformation {name: 'Transformation 1'}), (d:Destination {name: 'Destination X'})
CREATE (t)-[:DATA_FLOW]->(d)

### Connect Source B to Transformation 2

MATCH (s:Source {name: 'Source B'}), (t:Transformation {name: 'Transformation 2'})
CREATE (s)-[:DATA_FLOW]->(t)

### Connect Transformation 2 to Destination Y

MATCH (t:Transformation {name: 'Transformation 2'}), (d:Destination {name: 'Destination Y'})
CREATE (t)-[:DATA_FLOW]->(d)

In this example, we've created nodes for sources, transformations, and destinations, and established relationships to represent the flow of data between them.

You can query this graph to retrieve ETL lineage information. For instance, to find the lineage for a specific destination:
MATCH path = (:Source)-[:DATA_FLOW*]->(:Destination {name: 'Destination X'})
RETURN path

This query will return the paths that represent the ETL lineage for "Destination X".

Please note that this example is simplified, and in a real-world scenario, you might need to include additional properties, timestamps, and more complex relationships to accurately represent the ETL lineage. Additionally, you can use the power of Neo4j's Cypher query language to perform more advanced lineage tracking and analysis
