Step-by-Step Guide: Neo4j Monitoring in AWS

Step 1: Launch Neo4j on AWS

Launch a Neo4j instance on Amazon EC2 using an official AMI or your custom setup.
Step 2: Set Up Amazon CloudWatch for Basic Monitoring

Enable basic monitoring for your Neo4j EC2 instance:
Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
Select your Neo4j instance.
Under the "Monitoring" tab, enable detailed monitoring. This will send basic metrics to Amazon CloudWatch.
Step 3: Set Up Prometheus and Grafana

Launch an EC2 instance for Prometheus:

Choose an instance type suitable for your expected metrics load.
Install Prometheus as described in the previous steps.
Launch an EC2 instance for Grafana:

Choose an instance type suitable for your expected usage.
Install Grafana and configure it to connect to your Prometheus instance.
Step 4: Set Up Custom Metrics Collection (Optional)

To gather more detailed Neo4j metrics, you can use the official Neo4j Prometheus exporter. This will allow you to collect Neo4j-specific metrics beyond what CloudWatch provides.

Deploy the Neo4j Prometheus exporter on your Neo4j instance:

Set up the exporter according to its documentation, ensuring it scrapes metrics from Neo4j.
Configure Prometheus on the dedicated instance to scrape metrics from the Neo4j exporter:

Update your prometheus.yml file to include a job that scrapes metrics from the Neo4j exporter.
Step 5: Visualize Metrics in Grafana

Access Grafana on the instance where it's deployed:

Open your browser and navigate to the Grafana instance's public IP or domain.
Import Neo4j monitoring dashboards in Grafana:

Grafana has numerous community-contributed dashboards available.
Choose a suitable Neo4j monitoring dashboard and import it.
Configure the data source to point to your Prometheus instance.
Step 6: Advanced Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch (Optional)

For advanced monitoring, consider setting up custom CloudWatch Alarms based on metrics from the basic CloudWatch monitoring or the Prometheus exporter.

Create CloudWatch Alarms to receive notifications when specific thresholds are breached.

Step 7: Additional AWS Services (Optional)

You can leverage other AWS services for enhanced monitoring and management:
Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log aggregation and analysis.
