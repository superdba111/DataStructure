Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a powerful class of machine learning models designed to work directly with graph-structured data. While Neo4j is a graph database and not a GNN library, you can use Neo4j to preprocess and extract features from your graph data and then feed these features into a GNN library for training and prediction. Here's an example of how you might use Neo4j in conjunction with a GNN library (like PyTorch Geometric) to implement a simple graph classification task using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN):

Data Preparation in Neo4j:
Let's assume you have a graph in Neo4j where nodes represent entities and relationships represent connections between them. Each node has certain attributes. You want to classify graphs based on their content.

MATCH (n) RETURN n

Feature Extraction in Neo4j:
Calculate node features (attributes) and adjacency matrices (relationships) from Neo4j. You might need to normalize the adjacency matrix for GNNs.

import numpy as np
import torch
from torch_geometric.data import Data

### Retrieve node attributes and relationships from Neo4j
node_attributes = ...  # Extract node attributes from Neo4j query
adjacency_matrix = ...  # Extract adjacency matrix from Neo4j query

### Normalize adjacency matrix for GNNs
degrees = np.sum(adjacency_matrix, axis=1)
normalized_adjacency = np.diag(1.0 / np.sqrt(degrees)) @ adjacency_matrix @ np.diag(1.0 / np.sqrt(degrees))

### Convert data to PyTorch tensors
node_attributes = torch.tensor(node_attributes, dtype=torch.float32)
normalized_adjacency = torch.tensor(normalized_adjacency, dtype=torch.float32)

### Create a PyTorch Geometric Data object
data = Data(x=node_attributes, edge_index=normalized_adjacency)

Train a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN):
Now, you can use a GNN library like PyTorch Geometric to define and train a GCN model on your graph data.

from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch_geometric.data import DataLoader

class GCNClassifier(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super(GCNClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(hidden_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, data):
        x, edge_index = data.x, data.edge_index
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x, edge_index))
        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)
        return x

### Instantiate the model
model = GCNClassifier(input_dim=node_attributes.shape[1], hidden_dim=64, output_dim=num_classes)

### Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

### Train the model
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(data)
    loss = criterion(output[train_mask], labels[train_mask])
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

Evaluate the Model:
After training, you can evaluate the model's performance on a test set.

with torch.no_grad():
    model.eval()
    test_output = model(data)
    test_loss = criterion(test_output[test_mask], labels[test_mask])
    predicted_labels = test_output.argmax(dim=1)


Please note that this is a simplified example. In practice, you would also handle data splits, batching, early stopping, hyperparameter tuning, and other considerations. Additionally, different GNN architectures (e.g., GraphSAGE, GAT) might be more suitable depending on your data and task.
