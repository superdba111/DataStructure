Graph Traversal and Pattern Matching:
Cypher is often used to traverse graphs and match patterns within them. This is useful for querying relationships and nodes based on specific criteria.

Example: <br>
MATCH (p:Person)-[:FRIEND]->(f:Person) <br>
WHERE p.name = 'Alice'  <br>
RETURN f.name   <br>

Creating Nodes and Relationships:
You can use Cypher to create new nodes and relationships in the graph database.

Example: <br>
CREATE (alice:Person {name: 'Alice'}) <br>
CREATE (bob:Person {name: 'Bob'}) <br>
CREATE (alice)-[:FRIEND]->(bob)   <br>

Updating Data:
Cypher allows you to update existing nodes and relationships.

Example: <br>
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Alice'}) <br>
SET p.age = 30  <br>

Deleting Data:
You can use Cypher to delete nodes and relationships from the graph.

Example: <br>
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Bob'})-[r:FRIEND]->()  <br>
DELETE p, r  <br>

Aggregation and Analysis:
Cypher supports aggregation functions for summarizing data in the graph.

Example: <br>
MATCH (p:Person)-[:FRIEND]->()   <br>
RETURN p.name, count(*) AS friendCount <br>
ORDER BY friendCount DESC  <br>

Searching for Paths:
You can find paths between nodes using Cypher, which is useful for analyzing connectivity and shortest paths.

Example: <br>
MATCH path = shortestPath((alice:Person)-[:FRIEND*]->(bob:Person)) <br>
RETURN path  <br>

Recommendation Systems:
Cypher can be used to build recommendation systems by analyzing graph patterns and relationships.

Example: <br>
MATCH (user:User)-[:LIKES]->(product:Product)<-[:LIKES]-(otherUser:User) <br>
WHERE user.name = 'Alice'   <br>
RETURN otherUser.name, collect(product.name) AS commonLikes <br>

Graph Algorithms:
Neo4j provides graph algorithms that you can utilize through Cypher for tasks like community detection, centrality analysis, and more.

Example: <br>
CALL algo.betweenness.stream('Person', 'FRIEND', {direction: 'OUTGOING'}) <br>
YIELD nodeId, centrality  <br>
RETURN algo.getNodeById(nodeId).name AS person, centrality <br>
ORDER BY centrality DESC  <br>
