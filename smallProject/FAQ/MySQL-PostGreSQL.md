When to choose PostgreSQL or MySQL for your AWS RDS depends largely on the specific requirements of your application and your team's familiarity with these technologies. Here are some key considerations:

PostgreSQL: (https://github.com/superdba111/blog)

You should opt for PostgreSQL if your system requires complex queries, extensive data computations, and you need a highly customizable and extensible DBMS.
PostgreSQL supports a larger part of the SQL standard and offers many modern features: complex queries, foreign keys, triggers, views, transactional integrity, multiversion concurrency control.
It's well suited for systems requiring execution of complex queries, heavy analytics, and reporting.
MySQL:

Choose MySQL for its simplicity, widespread adoption, and extensive community support. It's an excellent choice for web-based projects that need a database merely for straightforward data transactions.
It's generally a good choice for applications requiring high read speeds and simpler relationships between tables.
MySQL might also be preferred if you're creating a read-intensive workload, given its efficient read operation performance.
System Design Checklist:

When designing your system to use RDS (either PostgreSQL or MySQL), here are some key points to consider:

Capacity Planning: Estimate the size of your data, number of users, and transaction rates to select the correct instance type and storage size.

Security: Plan for security groups, network access control, encryption needs (both at rest and in transit), and whether to use AWS IAM or database native authentication.

Backup and Recovery: Understand your data recovery requirements (RTO and RPO), and configure automated backups, snapshots, and replication accordingly.

Performance: Consider the need for read replicas for offloading read traffic, enabling Multi-AZ deployments for improved availability, and choosing the right type of storage based on your IOPS requirements.

Monitoring: Enable CloudWatch for monitoring database and OS metrics, Enhanced Monitoring for an in-depth view, and set up necessary alarms for critical metrics.

Maintenance: Define maintenance windows, handle minor and major upgrades, and decide on the parameter groups based on the engine requirements.

Cost: Consider pricing, including on-demand vs reserved instances, storage costs, data transfer costs, and snapshot costs.

Remember, it's important to regularly review and update your choices based on your evolving business and application needs. It's also recommended to conduct load testing and use AWS's database migration service to evaluate the performance of your chosen database engine.
