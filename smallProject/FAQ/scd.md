Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) are a concept in data management and data warehousing used to handle changes over time in the attributes or characteristics of a dimension.

In reality, the data in dimensions may not always be static. For instance, a customer's address might change, or a product's price might be updated. These changes need to be managed over time in a way that supports accurate historical reporting.

There are several types of SCDs, each representing a different approach to managing changes:

Type 0 - Retain Original:
In this approach, changes to data are not tracked. The data is static and retains its original value. This is useful for permanent data elements.

Type 1 - Overwrite:
In a Type 1 SCD, the new information simply overwrites the original information. In other words, no history is kept.

Type 2 - Add New Row:
This is one of the most commonly used methods. In a Type 2 SCD, a new row is added to the table with the new information. This allows you to keep a full history of changes. Usually, there's a "valid from" and "valid to" date to indicate the period of validity for a particular row.

Type 3 - Add New Attribute:
In a Type 3 SCD, you don't add a new row to track the changes. Instead, you add a new column to keep a record of the changes. This method keeps limited history as it shows only the original and the latest values.

Type 4 - Add History Table:
In a Type 4 SCD, also known as 'history table', a new table is created to track the changes, separating historical data from current data.

Type 6 - Combine Approaches:
This approach combines elements of Type 1, 2, and 3. It can track current and previous data, as well as the full change history.

How to handle SCDs depends on the type of SCD and the tools you're using. In SQL, you might use UPDATE statements for a Type 1 SCD, or INSERT statements for a Type 2 SCD. Many ETL tools also have built-in functionality to handle SCDs.

The approach to managing SCDs will depend on the business requirements. You'll need to consider factors like the importance of historical accuracy, the performance impact of the different SCD methods, and the complexity of implementation.
