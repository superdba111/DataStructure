pgvector is an open-source extension for PostgreSQL that adds the ability to store and search over ML-generated embeddings. pgvector provides different capabilities that let users identify both exact and approximate nearest neighbors. It’s designed to work seamlessly with other PostgreSQL features, including indexing and querying. You can even use pgvector to store ML embeddings from Amazon Bedrock (limited preview). pgvector’s indexing features further enhance search optimization. By indexing your vector data, you can expedite search processes and minimize the time required to identify the nearest neighbors to any given vector. We examine how the pgvector extension coalesces with PostgreSQL, providing a streamlined and effective solution for similarity searches on vector embeddings.
