Assuming you're looking for a Python-based solution to manage PostgreSQL schema changes, a commonly used tool is Alembic. Alembic is a database migration tool that allows you to track changes in your SQLAlchemy models and propagate those changes into your database schema.

Please note that while the code below provides an example of using Alembic to manage schema changes, setting up Alembic and SQLAlchemy in a real-world project can involve many more considerations, particularly around your project's structure and how your application interacts with your database.

Here's a basic example:

Set up your environment - You'll need to have Python, pip, a PostgreSQL server, and the necessary Python libraries installed.
You can install the necessary libraries with pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install alembic sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary
Configure Alembic - You'll need to create an alembic.ini file, which Alembic will use to determine how to interact with your database.
alembic.ini:

ini
Copy code
[alembic]
script_location = alembic

[alembic:exclude]
sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://username:password@localhost/dbname
Replace username, password, and dbname with your database credentials and name.

You'll also need to set up the env.py file within the alembic folder to tell Alembic how to interact with your database:

alembic/env.py:

from sqlalchemy import engine_from_config
from sqlalchemy import pool

from alembic import context

config = context.config

fileConfig(config.config_file_name)

target_metadata = None

def run_migrations_offline():
    """Run migrations in 'offline' mode.

    This configures the context with just a URL
    and not an Engine, though an Engine is acceptable
    here as well.  By skipping the Engine creation
    we don't even need a DBAPI to be available.

    Calls to context.execute() here emit the given string to the
    script output.

    """
    url = config.get_main_option("sqlalchemy.url")
    context.configure(
        url=url, target_metadata=target_metadata, literal_binds=True
    )

    with context.begin_transaction():
        context.run_migrations()


def run_migrations_online():
    """Run migrations in 'online' mode.

    In this scenario we need to create an Engine
    and associate a connection with the context.

    """
    connectable = engine_from_config(
        config.get_section(config.config_ini_section),
        prefix="sqlalchemy.",
        poolclass=pool.NullPool,
    )

    with connectable.connect() as connection:
        context.configure(
            connection=connection, target_metadata=target_metadata
        )

        with context.begin_transaction():
            context.run_migrations()


if context.is_offline_mode():
    run_migrations_offline()
else:
    run_migrations_online()


Create a migration script - Migration scripts are like a version history for your database. They contain instructions for how to get your database to a certain state.
You can create a new migration script with:

bash
Copy code
alembic revision -m "create users table"
This will create a new script in your alembic/versions directory. Open that file and update the upgrade and downgrade functions:

python
Copy code
def upgrade():
    op.create_table(
        'users',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(50), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False),
    )

def downgrade():
    op.drop_table('users')
The upgrade function is used when moving forward in your database's history (like when you create a new table), while downgrade is used when you need to go back to a previous state (like if you need to delete a table).

Apply the migrations - Once you have your migration script set up, you can apply the migrations to your database:
bash
Copy code
alembic upgrade head
This will apply all migrations that haven't been applied yet. If you ever need to undo a migration, you can do so with:

bash
Copy code
alembic downgrade -1
This will undo the last applied migration.

Remember to always backup your database before running migrations, especially on a production database. Migrations can occasionally go wrong, and you don't want to lose your data if they do.

Also, while Alembic can automatically generate migration scripts for you based on changes in your SQLAlchemy models (using the alembic revision --autogenerate command), it's recommended to always review and edit these scripts as necessary, as the autogenerated scripts may not always do exactly what you want.
