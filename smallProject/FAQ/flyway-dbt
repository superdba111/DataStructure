Both Flyway and dbt (short for "data build tool") are tools related to databases, but they serve somewhat different purposes. Let's break down the differences between them:

Purpose:

Flyway: Primarily a database migration tool. It helps manage and track the changes in the structure of your databases (e.g., creating tables, adding columns) and applies these changes in a version-controlled manner.
dbt: A transformation tool that focuses on the ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) paradigm. It helps users transform and model data in the warehouse, typically after raw data has been loaded.
Language & Scripts:

Flyway: Uses SQL-based migration scripts. Each script represents a version, and Flyway ensures that each version is applied in the correct order.
dbt: Uses SQL with Jinja2 templating to define transformations. This allows for generating dynamic SQL based on configurations and variables.
Workflow:

Flyway: The typical workflow involves writing a SQL migration script, running Flyway to apply migrations, and then Flyway records which migrations have been applied.
dbt: Involves writing models (SQL files that define transformations), testing those models with assertions, and then running dbt to apply transformations in the data warehouse.
Integration & Use Cases:

Flyway: Often integrated into CI/CD pipelines to ensure that database schema changes are tested and applied as part of the deployment process.
dbt: Integrated into data pipelines. After raw data is loaded into a data warehouse, dbt can be used to transform this data into a more analysis-friendly format.
Testing:

Flyway: Primarily concerned with ensuring successful database migrations. Doesn't have built-in functionality for data validation.
dbt: Has built-in capabilities for testing the transformed data, such as asserting uniqueness, not-null conditions, etc.
Platforms:

Flyway: Works with various relational databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.
dbt: Primarily targets modern cloud data platforms like Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and others.
Community & Plugins:

Flyway: Has a community, but the primary functionality is around migrations. Plugins and extensions are not as common.
dbt: Has a vibrant community that has built many plugins, macros, and packages. These can be used to extend dbt's functionality or simplify common tasks.
In essence, you could find yourself using both tools in the same ecosystem. For instance, you might use Flyway to manage changes in your application's primary relational database and dbt to manage transformations in your data warehouse.
