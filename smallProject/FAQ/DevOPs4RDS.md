AWS DevOps Guru is a machine learning powered service launched by AWS which helps in identifying operational issues, detecting anomalies and suggests ways to mitigate them. It gives you specific recommendations related to your application's setup, resources, and metrics. This is how you can setup and use AWS DevOps Guru for AWS RDS:

Navigate to the AWS DevOps Guru console: Go to the AWS Management Console, enter DevOps Guru in the "Find Services" box, and select DevOps Guru from the dropdown.

Enable DevOps Guru: If you are using DevOps Guru for the first time, you need to enable it. Click on the "Enable now" button.

Configure the Service: AWS DevOps Guru needs to know which resources it should analyze. You have the option to analyze all resources in your account or only resources that are tagged with specific tags.

If you want to specifically monitor your RDS PostgreSQL, you should tag that resource and then configure DevOps Guru to only analyze resources with that tag. This will ensure that DevOps Guru focuses on the resources you're interested in.

Review Insights: Once the service is enabled and configured, DevOps Guru will start analyzing your RDS PostgreSQL instance's CloudWatch metrics, CloudFormation stacks, and other data. It will use machine learning to identify any unusual activity or patterns that could signify a potential problem.

Addressing the Issues: DevOps Guru will provide a list of insights on its console. Each insight will include details about the problem, which resources are affected, when the problem started, and also suggestions for remediation. It's important to review these insights and take action to address the identified issues.

Setting Up Notifications: You can configure SNS notifications for DevOps Guru insights. This allows you to get immediate notifications when issues are detected, even if you're not currently looking at the AWS console.

Please remember AWS DevOps Guru is a tool to aid you in managing your AWS resources, including RDS PostgreSQL. However, it doesn't replace the need for a robust monitoring and alerting system, proper database and application design, and following best practices for using AWS services.
