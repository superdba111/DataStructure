Maintaining data integrity and quality in a highly available cloud infrastructure within AWS involves a combination of several strategies. Here are some important ones:

### Multi-AZ Deployments: 
AWS RDS service provides the ability to create a replica of your database in another Availability Zone (AZ) within the same region. This is called Multi-AZ deployments. In the case of an infrastructure failure, AWS RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby replica, ensuring the data availability.

### Read Replicas: 
For read-heavy database workloads, use read replicas. This helps balance the load and not put too much stress on a single database instance. AWS RDS supports creating one or more replicas of a database instance within a single or multiple AWS regions.

### Consistent Backups: 
Regular and consistent backups are crucial to data integrity. AWS RDS provides automated backups of your database instances. Also, consider taking manual snapshots before performing critical operations.

### Database Transaction Logs: 
Transaction logs help maintain data integrity by ensuring that database operations can be rolled back if needed. AWS RDS automatically backs up these logs as part of automated backups.

### Data Validation Checks: 
Implement data validation at both the application level and the database level to ensure that only the correct types of data are stored.

### DynamoDB: 
For NoSQL databases, DynamoDB is a great option. It provides built-in support for ACID transactions, ensuring data integrity. Also, DynamoDB Global Tables provide a fully managed solution for deploying a multi-region, multi-master database, which helps in maintaining high availability.

### S3 Versioning and Replication: 
If you're using S3 for data storage, enable versioning to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. To further enhance data integrity, you can replicate your S3 data across different regions.

### Data Lifecycle Management: 
Implement data lifecycle management policies to move your data to cost-effective storage classes based on frequency of access, and to archive infrequently accessed data. This also helps in maintaining data integrity.

### Encryption: 
To ensure data integrity and security, encrypt your data at rest and in transit. AWS RDS supports encryption at rest using AWS KMS, and encryption in transit using SSL/TLS.

### Monitoring: 
Use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring your AWS resources. Set up alarms for any unusual activity or errors. Also, consider using AWS CloudTrail for auditing purposes.

Maintaining data integrity and quality in data pipelines or workflows can be challenging due to the complexity of modern data systems. However, a well-structured plan and a set of best practices can help ensure the integrity and quality of data.

Here are a few strategies for ensuring data integrity and quality in your data pipelines or workflows:

### Data Validation: 
Implement data validation at all stages of your pipeline, from ingestion to processing and storage. This should include type checking, range checking, ensuring mandatory fields are present, and other business-specific rules.

### Implement Error Handling and Retry Logic: 
The pipeline should be robust to handle errors such as system failure, network issues, and incorrect data inputs. For transient issues, including a retry logic. Also, consider implementing a dead-letter queue to handle the messages that cannot be processed after maximum retry attempts.

### Data Versioning: 
Keep track of changes to your data over time. This can help you track any issues back to their source and can be invaluable when debugging problems or rolling back problematic changes.

### Use Data Cataloging Tools: 
Tools like AWS Glue can automatically discover and catalog metadata about your datasets. These metadata can provide useful context and can help enforce data quality rules.

### Monitor Your Pipelines: 
Use monitoring and logging services to track your pipeline's performance and catch any issues early. Services like Amazon CloudWatch can be used to monitor AWS data pipelines and can alert you to any issues.

### Test Your Pipelines: 
Ensure to test your data pipelines just like you would do with application code. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. This will help ensure your pipeline's functionality and can catch issues before they affect your data.

### Auditing: 
Implement auditing mechanisms in your pipeline to track who is accessing what data and when. This can be crucial for diagnosing issues and maintaining data integrity.

### Ensure Data is Immutable: 
Treat your data as immutable, meaning once data is written, it cannot be changed. If data needs to be updated, versioning should be used.

### Use Data Quality Tools: 
There are several data quality tools in the market, such as AWS Deequ, which can automatically check the quality of large datasets.

### Document Your Pipelines: 
Documentation can help ensure everyone on your team understands how the pipeline works and can reduce errors caused by misunderstandings or lack of knowledge.

By incorporating these strategies, you can build robust, reliable data pipelines that maintain the integrity and quality of your data throughout its lifecycle.
