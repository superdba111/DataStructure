Amazon RDS Proxy is a fully managed, highly available database proxy for Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) that makes applications more scalable, more resilient to database failures, and more secure.

Here are a few scenarios where using an RDS Proxy with PostgreSQL can be particularly useful:

Managing many simultaneous connections: Applications that open and close database connections at a high rate can cause a significant load on the database server. By reusing database connections, RDS Proxy can enhance the performance of your application and significantly reduce the load on the database server.

Scaling with Serverless applications: If you use AWS Lambda for your applications, it can create numerous simultaneous connections to your database when your application scales out. These connections can overwhelm your database and affect its ability to service requests. With RDS Proxy, you can ensure that your serverless applications can scale without affecting the performance of your database.

Improving application availability: If your application depends on a single database connection, it can be affected if that connection is interrupted for any reason. RDS Proxy maintains a pool of established connections to your RDS instances, improving your application's ability to recover from database failures and interruptions.

Securing data in transit: RDS Proxy automatically uses SSL for connections to RDS databases and IAM authentication, allowing credentials for your database to be managed by AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

Saving costs: Since the proxy manages and reuses connections, you might not need as many resources on the actual database, potentially lowering costs.

Before implementing RDS Proxy, keep in mind the additional latency it might introduce due to an extra network hop. For applications that require minimal latency, this might be a factor to consider.
