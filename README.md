# Algorithm + Data Structure = software programming (simply saying)

### Abstraction, Encapsulation, Modularisation, and Hierarchy (fundamental software design principles)

### A template or pattern describing a solution to a common problem is known as a design pattern. The reuse of such patterns can help speed up the software development process

There are all data structures available on Python.org

Examples for red black tree, see this pages https://pypi.org/project/bintrees/2.0.1/

You can import packages and call the data structures in your code

Here are just for practices on data structure concepts

In order to coding well, think about the following, 1. Efficiency. 2. Memory space, 3 Bug free with a complete testing cases
